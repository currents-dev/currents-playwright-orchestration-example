### Configuring Batch Size

It is recommended to set `batchSize = workers`

- Use `--pwc-batch-size` CLI params, e.g.: `pwc-p --pwc-batch-size=3`
- Set environment variable `CURRENTS_BATCH_SIZE` e.g.: `CURRENTS_BATCH_SIZE=3`
- Set the values in `currents.confg.ts`, e.g.: `orchestration.batchSize: 3`

### Suite Composition
